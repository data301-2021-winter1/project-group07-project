## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{When our team first saw the dataset, each of us asked himself a question: 1) Is there a correlation between the category of a startup, its success, and the most popular industry of a country? 2) What goal and project duration setting are most likely to fail on kickstarters? Although the research questions differ, they are both very interesting and astonishing to find answers to. Our team is interested in the dataset, because both of us strive for learning more about start-ups and self-proprietorship. We want to understand how kickstartes work, what kind of service they provide, and what the outcome for young entrepreneurs is. With the dataset that we chose, it will be interesting to analyze how various types of start-up industries correlate with the level of success of a start-up. We could imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with our dataset in order to provide fast, informative, and real-time summary of the dataset contents.}

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Kickstarter is a platform that promotes crowdfunding projects for creative idea. Project creator brings out a feasible idea, then sets project deadline and funding goals. If people like the idea, they can pledge money to help bring the project to life. They will also usually get something in return. This dataset is collected on Kickstarter.com between 2009 and 2018. The link to this dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects. The data is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. There are total 378661 rows and 15 columns of data. The data includes important information such as project name, country, category, sub-category, launch date, deadline, goal, and pledged amount for each project. Since different country project uses different currency for goal and amount pledged, the data convert them to USD for the purpose of comparison. The dataset would be great for several purposes: entrepreneurs can analyze the dataset and understand whether they have potential in their project. Also, the dataset is great for public interest in a way that people can learn the criteria of the study and may become interested in a topic of crowdfunding.
